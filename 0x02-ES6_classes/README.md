This project contains tasks for learning to use classes in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

Tasks To Complete
 0. You used to attend a place like this at some point
0- Prototype: export default class ClassRoom.
It should accept one attribute named maxStudentsSize (Number) and assigned to _maxStudentsSize.
 
 1. Let's make some classrooms
1- Import the ClassRoom class from 0-classroom.js.
Export a function named initializeRooms. It should return an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).
 2. A Course, Getters, and Setters
2- Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation.
Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
 
 3. Methods, static methods, computed methods names..... MONEY
3- Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullCurrency that will return the attributes in the format name (code).
 
 4. Pricing
4- Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js.

Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullPrice that returns the attributes in the format amount currency_name (currency_code).
Implement a static method named convertPrice. It should accept two arguments: amount (Number), conversionRate (Number). The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.
 
 5. A Building
5- Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).
Implement a getter for each attribute.

 6. Inheritance
6- Import Building from 4-building.js.
Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).

 7. Airport
7- Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).
The default string description of the class should return the airport code (example below).
 
 8. Primitive - Holberton Class
8- Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).
When the class is cast into a Number, it should return the size.
When the class is cast into a String, it should return the location.
 
 9. Hoisting
9- export const listOfStudents = [student1, student2, student3, student4, student5];
 
 10. Vroom
10- Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name).
Add a method named cloneCar. This method should return a new object of the class.

 11. EVCar
100- Import Car from 10-car.js.
